# flasknotes
Very simple note taking app in flask - python.


If running in linux, run the following bash command prior to running the app, or change the name of main.py to app.py or whatever flask expects your main python file to be.

export FLASK_APP=main


To run the app on all interfaces use the following command:

flask run --host=0.0.0.0
